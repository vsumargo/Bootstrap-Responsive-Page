                                    <p>My name is Vincent Sumargo, born in Indonesia, and has been living in Australia
                                        for
                                        more than 15 years. Majoring in Civil Engineering, I have been working in the
                                        construction sector for more than 6 year and has my own business in
                                        Indonesia as a Building Contractor.
                                    </p>


                                    <p>
                                        Due to the effect of COVID-19, many business have been forced to shut down and
                                        the
                                        one that survive
                                        are those that have an online presence, whether through website, online
                                        meetings,
                                        social media and so on.
                                        Hence, I decided to learn new skills that is relevant for the future such web
                                        development, coding and programming just to name a few.
                                        The first step that I have taken is enrolling in UWA Coding Bootcamp as a
                                        starting
                                        point in pursuin career in coding and programming.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The critical thinking skills that I have polished as a civil engineer, combined
                                        with
                                        the management skills that I learned and experienced as
                                        a business owner, and with a strong logical thinking ability, these skills will
                                        equip me as a programmer or web-developer to thrive in the dynamics of I.T
                                        industry.
